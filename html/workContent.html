<h2>
	Tore's Work Experience
</h2>
<p>
	Over the past few years I have done programming, design, and web development work in a variety of different companies.  Most recently I was an intern at Cambia Health Solutions, a Non-profit Healthcare company in the Pacific Northwest, where I was developing javascript applications.  The following is a more complete list of the places I have worked and my responsibilities while in each role.
	<ul>
		<li>Cambia</li>
		<li>Crocs</li>
		<li>UW CSE TA</li>
		<li>bivio Software</li>
	</ul>
</p>

	In addition to IT related work, I have participated in a number of side projects, some of which are on <a href="http://www.github.com/thans">my GitHub account</a>.  The last project I completed that was used by others was the <a href="http://bit.ly/2012lpc">Lighthouse Photo Contest</a>.  Some of my friends I was living with wanted to have a photography competition within our house where we could vote each week for the best photo.  My housemate Mitchell and I decided to open the competition to our friends and anyone around us by creating a website that would keep track of votes and hide the identity of the photographer.  The result was the Lighthouse Photo Contest.

		<li>"Reading Buddies" Volunteer</li>
	</ul>
