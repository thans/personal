	About Tore
</h2>
<p>
	Hi! My name is Tore Hanssen and I am a passionate programmer who likes to work hard and have fun along the way.  Born and raised in Colorado, I currently reside in Seattle where I am a Computer Engineering major at The University of Washington.
</p>
<p>
	I enjoy going on runs, lifting weights, throwing the ole' pigskin around, cooking, and laughing.

<p>
	Recently, one of my favorite quotes (from Perl's Larry Wall) has become: "There's more than one way to do it."  Hopefully this reminder takes some stress out of your day.  Please take a look around to learn more about me and my accomplishements.  Feel free to drop me an email as well!
	<p>
		Cheers!
